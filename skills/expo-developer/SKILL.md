# Expo Developer

## Purpose

Build, refactor, debug, test, and review production React Native applications using Expo and the Expo development/build ecosystem.

## When to Use

Use for:

- Expo applications
- Expo Router
- Expo SDK APIs
- Expo modules
- app configuration
- development builds
- EAS Build and related release workflows
- permissions and device capabilities
- OTA update strategy
- React Native features implemented through Expo

## When Not to Use

Do not use as the primary skill for generic React web applications, non-Expo React Native CLI projects, backend services, or product/visual design.

## Inputs

Inspect before changing:

- `package.json`
- Expo SDK version
- `app.json` / `app.config.*`
- Expo Router structure when present
- native directories if present
- EAS configuration
- installed Expo modules
- build/update configuration
- tests

Determine whether the project uses managed, prebuild, or a custom native workflow before changing configuration.

## Workflow

```text
REQUIREMENTS
→ EXPO PROJECT INSPECTION
→ SDK / WORKFLOW CHECK
→ PLAN
→ IMPLEMENT
→ VALIDATE
→ BUILD / DEVICE VERIFY
→ RELEASE REVIEW
```

### SDK Compatibility

Use APIs and packages compatible with the project's Expo SDK. Do not casually mix package versions across SDK generations.

### Configuration

Understand whether a value belongs in Expo config, environment configuration, native configuration, or runtime application code.

Never put secrets into values that are bundled into the client application.

### Native Capabilities

When a feature requires native functionality, determine whether an Expo API/module already provides it before introducing custom native code.

### Builds

For features that depend on native configuration, verify a development/release build rather than relying only on Metro or JavaScript tests.

### Updates

When using OTA updates, distinguish JavaScript/assets changes from native binary changes. Do not assume an OTA update can replace a required native binary change.

## Decision Rules

- Prefer Expo-supported APIs and modules when appropriate.
- Preserve the project's existing workflow unless a migration is required.
- Use Expo Router when it is already established in the project; do not introduce a second navigation architecture unnecessarily.
- Keep configuration centralized and explicit.
- Treat native dependency compatibility as a release concern.
- Use development builds when native capabilities require them.
- Separate build-time configuration from runtime secrets.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- blindly copying configuration from another Expo project
- mixing incompatible Expo SDK/package versions
- putting secrets in `app.json` or client environment variables
- assuming every native package works in Expo Go
- skipping development/release build verification
- using OTA updates to deliver native changes
- unnecessary prebuild/native customization
- changing SDK versions to solve unrelated bugs
- ignoring Android/iOS differences

## Quality Bar

Production Expo work should have:

- SDK-compatible dependencies
- correct app configuration
- predictable navigation
- explicit loading/error/permission states
- tested device capabilities
- appropriate accessibility
- validated development/release build when native behavior changed
- clear update/release implications

## Verification

Run applicable:

- lint
- type checking
- tests
- Expo diagnostics/checks
- development build
- Android/iOS device or emulator verification
- EAS build checks where release behavior is affected

Confirm that configuration changes are reflected in the actual generated/built application when applicable.

## Security

Review:

- client-visible environment variables
- secure token storage
- permissions
- deep links
- WebViews
- push notification credentials
- EAS credentials and signing configuration
- third-party modules

Never commit signing credentials, private keys, or secrets.

## Output

Report implementation details, Expo SDK/package impact, configuration changes, validation/build results, and known release limitations.

## Definition of Done

- requirement is implemented
- Expo workflow was identified before changes
- SDK compatibility was checked
- configuration is correct
- relevant tests/checks pass
- native behavior was built/tested where applicable
- security and release implications were reviewed
- no unnecessary migration or native complexity was introduced
