# React JS Developer

## Purpose

Build, refactor, debug, review, and verify production-quality React web applications. This skill focuses on React-specific engineering while coordinating with frontend design, API, security, testing, and architecture skills when required.

## When to Use

Use when the task involves:

- React components, hooks, state, props, context, or composition
- React web application architecture
- React routing and data loading
- forms and client-side interactions
- performance optimization
- accessibility implementation in React
- React testing
- migration or refactoring of React code

## When Not to Use

Do not use as the primary skill for:

- generic HTML/CSS design without React behavior
- backend/API implementation
- React Native mobile applications
- infrastructure or deployment work
- product requirements or visual design direction

Delegate those concerns to the appropriate specialist.

## Inputs

Required where applicable:

- existing React project or clear application requirements
- target React/runtime constraints
- acceptance criteria

Inspect the repository before selecting patterns or dependencies.

## Workflow

```text
UNDERSTAND
→ INSPECT
→ PLAN
→ IMPLEMENT
→ TEST
→ REVIEW
→ VERIFY
```

### 1. Understand

Identify user-visible behavior, data flow, constraints, and acceptance criteria.

### 2. Inspect

Inspect:

- package configuration
- React version
- routing
- state management
- existing component patterns
- styling system
- API/data layer
- tests
- lint/type-check configuration

Prefer existing project conventions unless there is a documented reason to change them.

### 3. Plan

Choose the smallest architecture that satisfies the requirement.

Consider:

- component boundaries
- state ownership
- server/client data responsibilities
- reusable hooks
- error/loading/empty states
- accessibility
- performance

### 4. Implement

Build composable components with clear responsibilities.

Prefer:

- semantic HTML
- predictable state ownership
- stable component APIs
- reusable domain logic
- explicit loading and error states
- minimal dependencies

### 5. Test

Run applicable:

- unit tests
- component tests
- integration tests
- type checking
- linting
- build checks

### 6. Review

Check for unnecessary re-renders, stale state, incorrect effects, prop drilling, duplicated logic, inaccessible interactions, race conditions, and unnecessary abstractions.

### 7. Verify

Verify the changed behavior against acceptance criteria and actual application behavior where possible.

## Decision Rules

### State

Keep state as close as practical to where it is consumed. Do not introduce global state for local concerns.

### Effects

Use effects for synchronization with external systems, not as a default mechanism for deriving values or sequencing ordinary render logic.

### Components

Split components when responsibility, reuse, testability, or readability materially improves. Do not fragment simple UI into arbitrary micro-components.

### Performance

Measure or identify a credible performance issue before adding memoization, caching, virtualization, or complex state machinery.

### Dependencies

Prefer existing dependencies. Add a dependency only when its value justifies maintenance, security, bundle, and complexity costs.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- giant components with unrelated responsibilities
- unnecessary `useEffect`
- derived state stored redundantly
- global state for local UI state
- index keys for unstable dynamic collections
- ignoring loading/error/empty states
- inaccessible clickable `div`s when semantic controls are available
- premature memoization
- unnecessary state libraries
- hiding API failures from users
- rewriting working architecture without a requirement

## Quality Bar

A production React implementation should have:

- clear component responsibilities
- predictable state/data flow
- accessible interaction
- explicit loading/error/empty behavior
- appropriate typing when TypeScript is used
- tests for important behavior
- no known blocking lint/type/build errors
- minimal unnecessary dependencies
- consistency with the existing project architecture

## Verification

Report:

- files changed
- tests/checks run
- relevant results
- known limitations
- remaining risks

Never claim a UI is verified when only source inspection was performed.

## Security

Consider:

- XSS and unsafe HTML rendering
- untrusted URL/content handling
- authentication state
- authorization assumptions
- sensitive data in client bundles or local storage
- exposed API keys
- dependency vulnerabilities

Never place secrets intended for server-side use into client-side code.

## Output

Produce the requested React implementation plus a concise implementation/verification summary.

## Definition of Done

- requirements are satisfied
- existing architecture was inspected
- implementation follows project conventions
- accessibility was considered
- loading/error/empty states are handled where relevant
- applicable tests/type checks/lint/build checks pass
- security implications were considered
- no unnecessary architecture was introduced
