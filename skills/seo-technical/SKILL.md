# Technical SEO

## Purpose

Diagnose technical search visibility problems across crawlability, indexability, security, URLs, mobile experience, performance, JavaScript rendering, structured data, and internationalization-related controls.

## When to Use

Use for:

- robots.txt and sitemap issues
- indexing/canonical/noindex problems
- Core Web Vitals and page performance
- HTTPS and security-header review
- JavaScript rendering and SSR/CSR SEO issues
- URL/redirect architecture
- mobile SEO
- structured-data implementation checks
- hreflang and international technical issues

## Inputs

Required:
- target URL/domain

Optional:
- site architecture
- sitemap URLs
- Search Console data
- PageSpeed/CrUX data
- target markets/languages

Inspect actual responses before making conclusions.

## Workflow

```text
RENDER
→ CRAWL
→ CHECK CRAWLABILITY
→ CHECK INDEXABILITY
→ CHECK SECURITY
→ CHECK PERFORMANCE
→ CHECK JS RENDERING
→ CHECK STRUCTURED DATA
→ CHECK MOBILE / INTERNATIONAL
→ VERIFY
→ REPORT
```

## Core Checks

### Crawlability

Inspect:

- robots.txt
- XML sitemaps
- crawlable internal links
- blocked resources
- redirects
- crawl depth where measurable

### Indexability

Inspect:

- HTTP status
- canonical tags
- robots directives
- duplicate/parameter variants
- sitemap/canonical consistency
- accidental thin or duplicate URL surfaces

### Security

Review HTTPS, mixed content, and relevant security headers. Security headers should be treated as a technical-quality concern, not automatically as direct ranking factors.

### Performance

Use appropriate real-user or lab evidence where available. Treat Core Web Vitals as measured signals rather than guessing from code alone.

### JavaScript

Check whether title, canonical, robots, primary content, links, and structured data are present correctly in the initial response when practical. Verify rendered output for JS-heavy applications.

### Mobile

Check responsive behavior, content parity, viewport configuration, touch usability, and layout stability.

### Structured Data

Detect supported structured data, inspect validity, and route detailed schema work to a specialized schema skill when available.

## Decision Rules

- Prefer evidence from actual HTTP/rendered responses.
- Separate technical defects from recommendations.
- Do not claim a page is indexed without appropriate evidence.
- Do not recommend obsolete SEO practices without verifying current guidance.
- When a fix depends on Google processing time, state that it may take time to be reflected.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- declaring crawlability from robots.txt alone
- assuming a 200 response means successful indexing
- relying only on Lighthouse scores
- treating every security header as a ranking signal
- recommending canonical/noindex changes without checking site-wide URL relationships
- ignoring JavaScript-rendered output
- changing production SEO directives without considering traffic/indexation impact

## Verification

Use applicable:

- HTTP response inspection
- browser rendering
- sitemap/robots validation
- PageSpeed Insights or CrUX data
- structured-data validation
- Search Console evidence when available
- screenshots for visual/mobile claims

## Security

Protect private analytics, Search Console credentials, API tokens, and authenticated site data.

## Output

Report:

```text

## Definition of Done

- affected technical surface was inspected
- evidence supports findings
- important crawl/indexability/security/performance issues were considered
- JS/mobile impacts were checked where relevant
- recommendations are actionable
- limitations are explicit
